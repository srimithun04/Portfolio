# My Personal Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background as a Computer Science student. It's built with modern web technologies to be fully responsive, interactive, and visually engaging.


## ‚ú® About The Project

This portfolio was created to serve as a dynamic and modern resume. It highlights my journey into software development, the technologies I've worked with, and the projects I'm proud of. The goal was to create an experience that is not just informative but also playful and professional.

### Key Features:
* **Interactive UI:** Features like a typing hero text, flipping project cards, and a dynamic particle background create an engaging user experience.
* **Smooth Animations:** Sections gracefully animate into view on scroll, and hover effects provide satisfying feedback.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
* **Dynamic Content:** Skills and projects are loaded from a central JavaScript object, making the portfolio easy to update and maintain.
* **Clean & Organized Code:** The project is structured with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for better organization and scalability.
